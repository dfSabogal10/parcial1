  "readme": "# babel-preset-react-app\n\nThis package includes the Babel preset used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>\nPlease refer to its documentation:\n\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.\n\n## Usage in Create React App Projects\n\nThe easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**\n\n## Usage Outside of Create React App\n\nIf you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.\n\nFirst, [install Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/).\n\nThen create a file named `.babelrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    \"presets\": [\"react-app\"]\n  }\n  ```\n\nThis preset uses the `useBuiltIns` option with [transform-object-rest-spread](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/) and [transform-react-jsx](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/), which assumes that `Object.assign` is available or polyfilled.\n",
